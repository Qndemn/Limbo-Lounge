# Limbo-Lounge
ℚ Hi! let me just say, that any loss of a limb, organ or head is by all means not our fault! really. For the love of god, this is a TEXT-BASED game, pal. I do understand how you might LOSE YOUR HEAD over the RICH LORE (that's your cue to laugh, you ungrateful little-) or LOSE YOUR ORGANS over the absolute psychological terror that the game implies, or LOSE YOUR LIMBS because- okay, I've taken this too far, just download the game, for the love of god. (P.S: I'm homeless and need the money.) (P.S.S just joking) (P.S.S.S Hey, is piracy actually a crime? becuase if it is, i may have to leave VERY quickly.) ℚ
